# ML_Churn_Prediction

As a Data Challenge for the Machine Learning exam at Bocconi, I carryed out a classification task with a weighted misclassification loss. \
The aim was to predict whether clients of a telecommunication company would end the subscription in the upcoming month. \
The code isn't polished as it was an assignment done in 2-3 days, but in `Churn Prediction Report.pdf` all the relevant steps are briefly outlined.

**I scored 8th on the leaderbord**, populated by around 80 talented classmates.

Some of the relevant steps were: Feature Engineering, Model Stacking, Evaluation of Feature Importance (understanding which variables are most important for this business problem)
